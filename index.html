                    <h2>Background</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I'm Oscar Grajeda. I'm 24 years old, and I'm the oldest of three. I graduated from Dobson
                        High School in 2014, afterwards I attended community college for four years and never got a
                        degree. It was very difficult for me to find something I enjoyed and/or wanted to persue as a
                        career so I gave up college and dedited to work until I found something worth my time and money.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Luckily I was introduced to coding in early 2020 by a fiend. That led me to doing extensive
                        research and that's how I found Univercity of Arizona's Coding Bootcamp. It has been challenging
                        but also fun since day one (yes I said fun). To my surprise I ended up really liking the world
                        of Web Development.

                        At the moment my class and I are in the third week of school and we're learning about
                        JavaScript. This bootcamp is six months long which is so much better than two or four years. I'm
                        really looking forward to learning as much as I can to (hopefully) be employeed before or right
                        after graduation. I think it would be really cool to work for Netflix.
