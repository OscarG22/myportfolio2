# myportfolio2

This project was about using Bootstrap to make a responsive portfolio. When you first open the link you will appear in the Home page. There you'll be able to read about my background before this Bootcamp and also what I look forward to once I graduate. In the Portfolio page you will find a couple of stock images. Last but not least in the Contact page you will see that I included some links to my social media pages and you can also email me.
